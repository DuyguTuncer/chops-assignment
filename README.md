Road-map for the project:

1) Check the data types with if-else statements to make sure that the arguments that get passed are the desired data types, if not, give error.

2) Use string methods and iterators (array methods) in order to:
    
    - use split() method the data to use array methods,
    - clear the curly brackets from the string items that is passed with data argument,
    - access the value of the property that gets passed with the template argument,
    - replace the values (the one in the curly brackes with the value of the properties),
    - take the replaced values and render it as the whole string.

3) Integrate Typescript, use type annotations to make sure to pass the right values.

4) Use Jest to test different conditions.

1) "Split method is applied to the data argument, to make each word in string that gets passed via the argument -data- as an array item, so that array methods can be applicable on the next steps. 

 -Arter this step, filter method is applied to filter the items in the curly brackets." 
 -Slice() method is applied to filter the string items that has double curly brackets on the beggining and at the end.
